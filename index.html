                    <h2>What are the Canada Summer Games?</h2>
                    <p>The 2013 Canada Summer Games is a national multi-sport event that was held in Sherbrooke, Quebec from August 2, 2013 to August 17, 2013.[2] These Games were the first Canada Summer Games to be held in Quebec, and third overall after the inaugural Canada Winter Games in Quebec City in 1967 and the 1983 Canada Winter Games in Saguenay.</p>
                    <p>The Université de Sherbrooke is a large public French-language university in Quebec, Canada with campuses located in Sherbrooke and Longueuil, a suburb of Montreal approximately 130 km (81 mi) west of Sherbrooke. It is one of two universities in the Estrie region of Quebec (the other one being Bishop's University), and the only French-language university for the region.</p>
                    <p>In 2007, the Université de Sherbrooke was home to 40,000 students and a teaching staff of 3,200. In all, it employs 6,400 people. The university has over 100,000 graduates and offers 46 undergraduate, 48 master's and 27 doctoral programs. It holds a total of 61 research chairs, among which are the pharmacology, microelectronics, statistical learning, and environment research chairs.</p>
                    <p>The Université de Sherbrooke was established in 1954 as a French-speaking Catholic university in a region that was predominantly English speaking, Estrie or Eastern Township. The only university in this region was the English-based Anglican Bishop's University for over 100 years, The Roman Catholic Church created this university in an effort to provide a more convenient education for the Catholic and French speakers in the region, then as a minority. Initially there was a religious component to the pedagogical activities, but by the end of the 1960s the number of priests working for the university had greatly diminished during Quiet Revolution. In 1975, the appointment of a layman as Rector marked the end of religious activity in the institution. The Department of Theology is still officially Roman Catholic, alone in Quebec in this regard.</p>
